# 3.0-Educational-Game
Each group will first create a google doc with all team members names, and then  propose 3 unique game ideas each (3 ideas per team member), that includes the base game (reference the URL to the Greenfoot scenario), and a discussion of how the game could be modified to become an educational game.


Once all team members submit 3 ideas, the team should create a decision matrix that is used to choose which game to modify for the final game,  and then describe all modifications, that may include ideas from each team member's individual submissions.

Brainstorming documentation and decision matrix will be due Aug 18 (updated)

Finally, the team should outline a milestone chart to outline the work to be done to complete the game, and track responsibilities and time worked for each team member, and features from the runestone site. It should include the following columns:


Task Name     |  Assigned to |  Estimated. Hrs  |   Actual Hrs  |   Completion Date |  Topics Implemented  |  Comments
